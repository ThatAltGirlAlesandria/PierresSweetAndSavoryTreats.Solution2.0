[Download here for GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* _Installation of .Net 6.0 and C# for applied language_
[Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
* _Afterword, download MySQL Server & Workbench_
[Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

## Step-by-step breakdown of how to download and run this program on your computer
* _Clone this repo by opening GitBash, and navigating to the location you wish to clone the repo to._
* _Navigate to the root directory of the project in the command line and run the following command_
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ThatAltGirlAlesandria/PierresSweetAndSavoryTreats.Solution2.0
```
* _After cloning the repo in the location of your choice, set up your working environment by running_
```
$ dotnet build
```
* _Next create a .gitignore file in the root directory by typing the following into the command line_
```$ touch .gitignore``` 
* _Now, open your file in a text editor by typing in the command_
```
$ code .
```
* _Once your text editor launches, navigate to the .gitignore file and paste the following code and save the file_
```
obj
bin
appsettings.json
```
* _Now, open your command line again and make a commit. By making this commit BEFORE pushing to GitHub you will make sure the files that should be private/ not uploaded won't show. This is important because you don't want to share your username and password with everyone!_

#### Now that you have downloaded the repo and opened it in the text editor you need to open MySQL workbench.
* _Download [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) if you don't have it on your computer already_
* _After setting up your MySQL if you haven't done it already, in the Navigator make sure you are in the Administration Window_
* _Select Data Import/Restore from the menu_
* _In the Import Options pop-up window select, "Import from Self-Contained File"_
* _Navigate to the SQL file located in the root directory of the project you cloned called alesandria_wild.sql_
* _Under Default Schema to be Imported To, select the New Button_
* _Choose a name you would like for the database or continue to use alesandria_wild.sql if you're more comfortable with that_
* _Click OK_
* _You should see some tabs in the MySQL Workbench; navigate to the tab called "Import Progress" and click Start Import which is located in the bottom right corner of the tab_
* _Once you have finished the steps above locate the Schemas tab in the Navigator_
* _Right-click in the Schemas window of the Navigator and select Refresh All_
* _The database you just created should now appear in the Schema window_

#### Final steps, connecting your new database to the HairSalon program.
* _Open your command line application again_
* _Navigate to the production directory (should be called HairSalon)_
* _Open the text editor again using the same steps as above._
* _Now that you have opened the text editor again, you should see a new file listed called appsettings.json (we put this in the .gitignore file earlier)_
* _Open the file, and paste the following code_
```{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[your_database];uid=[user-id];pwd=[password];"
  }
}
```
* _Replace [you_database] with the name of your database (alesandria_wild.sql)_
* _Replace [user-id] with your SQL username_
* _Replace [password] with your SQL password_
* _Lastly, in your command line type_
```
$ dotnet watch run
```
